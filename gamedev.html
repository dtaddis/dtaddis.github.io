    <h2>VR Games Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the VR games <strong>Home Detective</strong>, <strong>Going Loco</strong> and <strong>Going Loco: FREE RIDE</strong>. It was last updated on <strong>25th June 2025</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Platform Specific Services</h3>
    <p>The games are available via the Meta platform. The platform holder may collect various data on you. The only collected data we have access to is aggregate data in the form of sales numbers split by geographic location (country-level).</p>
    <p>For more info on your privacy rights and management tools on the Meta platform:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.meta.com/gb/legal/quest/privacy-policy-for-oculus-account-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.meta.com/gb/legal/quest/privacy-policy-for-oculus-account-users/</a></p>

    <h3>Data Accessed by the App</h3>
    <p>In-game, the app requests access to certain data related to the player's account:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The player's age group</li>
      <li>The player's username</li>
      <li>The player's user id</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is stored and processed by PlayFab, which we use for handling a highscores leaderboard system, and mod.io, which we use for storing and serving community-created levels. None of this data is stored permanently by the developer.</p>

    <h3>Deletion of User Data</h3>
    <p>No data is stored by the developer. To delete any data stored by PlayFab or mod.io, there are buttons to request deletion from each service in the Options Menu. For further inquiries, I may be contacted using the following email address: <em>gamedev @ davidaddis . com (remove the spaces)</em>.</p>

    <p>More information on the data stored by PlayFab and mod.io can be found at:</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Game Engine</h3>
    <p>We use Unity as the game engine for both games. We have disabled all forms of Unity Analytics tracking in the game.</p>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the site. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
